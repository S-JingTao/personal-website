## About Me

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D student at NERC-RVC, Hunan University, under supervision of [Prof. Yaonan Wang](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1277/4490.htm). Currently, I am also a visiting scholar at the Show Lab in the National University of Singpore (NUS), advised by [Prof. Mike Zheng Shou](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/shou-zheng-mike/). 
I received my bachelor’s degree and master’s degree from Hunan University, supervised by Prof. Yaonan Wang and Prof. Jianhao Tan.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am interested in 6-DoF pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. I am also interested in robot learning, self-supervised/zero-shot learning, and applications in real-world robotic tasks.
